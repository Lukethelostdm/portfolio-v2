**Overview**

*Project Difficulty 2/5*

This was an experience in so many ways. To begin as all projects of mine do, I sent across a Figma wireframe, just to clarify the initial design. From there I began to work. 
The client was adamant they only wanted something simple, using HTML, CSS & at a bit Javascript. This was absolutely fine by me, the basics are always good to go back to and practice more of. 
From there, the code itself was mostly simple and straightforward.

**Concept**

This project initially broke down into a couple of different components. A homepage, a page for fiction, a page for non-fiction, a contact page, an about page, a news and events page and finally individual pages for each book.
After going back and forth on this for a while, we narrowed it down a bit as some of these pages could be naturally grouped together. We went back and forth over a few details before finally agreeing and setting the contract in writing.

**Design**

To begin with I created the home page, using a mix of HTML & CSS. It was straight forward enough, consisting of a navigation bar, an about section, recent releases and a footer. Originally we used a modal effect for pop ups, whenever someone clicked on the books or news options but the client wanted that adjusted, which was done quickly. 
The client wanted to be able to create their own news segments once the project was complete, meaning that they wanted something simple, that they&apos;d used before and quick. For this reason I settled on using Google Sheets and called it as an API. 

**Conclusion**

This project was simple enough, I delivered it under the time frame and under budget, for which the client was happy. Looking back, I realise there was a few things I could change and a few things I could add, but I think that&apos;s just me doing what I do best: Over complicating.

This project was a huge learning curve in regards to self discipline, making sure I put my best foot forward and continuing to push myself, even on bad days. In the time between this project and my next, I feel like I&apos;ve grown and developed so much already. I&apos;m interested to see what happens in the next year.

Bye for now!
