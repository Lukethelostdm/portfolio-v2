**Overview**

*Project Difficulty: 2/5.*

This is the case study for my portfolio. The highs, lows and everything in between. Alongside this I will also include what I have learned and how I can improve my own skills as a developer. I&apos;m hoping that this can be a landmark and a stepping stone for my future career.


**Concept**  
Initially I was unsure of what I wanted to create. I wanted to make something that would showcase my skills and be visually appealing. After some brainstorming, I decided to create a portfolio that would highlight my projects and skills. I wanted it to be simple yet effective while also being a huge improvement on my previous portfolio, which was mocked up within a day. This portfolio took me a week to complete and I&apos;m much happier with the result, it has a modern design and is using modern frameworks to make it easy to update and maintain, while showing that I can work with a variety of technologies.

**Design**  
Looking at my previous portfolio, I knew I wanted to make something that was much more visually appealing to clients. I wanted to make sure that my portfolio was easy to navigate and that the projects I had worked on were the stars of the show. To achieve this I used Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and React to create a modern and responsive design. To really take it to the next level, I also included a dark and light mode as I really enjoy the aesthetic of dark mode and I know it&apos;s a feature that many users are looking for. Along with all of this, I have been keeping an eye on my lighthouse and web vitals scores to ensure that my portfolio is as fast and efficient as possible. My next step is to make sure that my portfolio is accessible to all users, which I will be working on in the coming weeks, I have already started by adding alt text to all of my images and making sure that my navigation is accessible. I am also looking at improving my current logo with the hope of making it more appealing and so that it stands out in both light and dark mode. 

**Coding**  
As I mentioned, I have been using new frame works that I have never used before, which has been a challenge but also a great learning experience. I have been able to learn and implement new skills such as using Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and React, which has given me a massive confidence boost. However, with them being new technologies, I have found that there have been a few bugs and issues that I have had to overcome. Unexpectedly , I have found that the biggest challenge has been getting my head around the new technologies and how they interact with one another. This has been a truly unique challenge, one where I have had many *MANY* doubts about my own abilities. However, with the help of online communities and documentation, I have been able to overcome these challenges and create something that I am truly proud of. I also believe I have become a better developer, which is the most important thing of all. 

**What&apos;s Next (JS)?**

Get it?

So, what&apos;s next? Currently I am building a website for a freelance artist which is allowing me to practice my skills in a real-world setting, while also trying out more systems I am unfamiliar with such as Cloudinary. 
I am also looking to keep track of my progress and share my knowledge with others. I am hoping that this will be a great way to give back to the community and help others who are in the same position as I was as a beginner.

**Closing thoughts.**

I am really proud of what I have achieved with this portfolio and I am excited to see where my journey takes me next. I am looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead and I am confident that I have the skills and knowledge to overcome them. I am excited to see what the future holds and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my journey with you.
